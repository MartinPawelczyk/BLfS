"""Adapters: the only file in tests/ you edit.

Each function below is called by the tests. Replace the `raise NotImplementedError`
bodies with calls into your own code in `lm/`. Keep the signatures; the tests pass
arguments by keyword. Conventions the tests assume (see the handout, Section 4):

* Linear weights are stored as W of shape (d_out, d_in) and applied as x @ W.T,
  i.e. einsum(x, W, "... i, o i -> ... o"). No biases anywhere.
* Multi-head attention splits the projection output into heads by contiguous
  chunks: query head h uses rows [h*d_head, (h+1)*d_head) of q_proj_weight.
  With grouped-query attention (num_kv_heads < num_heads), query head h uses
  key/value head h // (num_heads // num_kv_heads).
* RoPE rotates the pairs (x[2i], x[2i+1]) of each head by pos * theta**(-2i/d_head)
  and is applied to queries and keys after the head split, never to values.
* Weight dictionaries for whole blocks/models use the keys documented in
  run_transformer_block and run_transformer_lm; map them to your module names.
